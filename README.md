# Adaptive AI Training: Dynamic Model Optimization through Probabilistic Tuning

## Overview
This project introduces a novel approach to AI model training, utilizing dynamic adjustments and probabilistic tuning to enhance the model's performance. By simulating various training scenarios, the script evaluates the model's effectiveness across 1000 tests, aiming to optimize parameters for better success rates.

## Features
- **Dynamic Training Adjustments:** Automatically adjusts training probabilities based on model performance.
- **Probabilistic Tuning:** Employs a unique method of probabilistic adjustments to fine-tune model parameters.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Simulates training scenarios to assess the model's effectiveness over numerous trials.

## Getting Started
To use this script, clone the repository to your local machine. Ensure Python is installed and run the script with the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
